# 🗳️ Electoral Bonds SQL Analysis Project

This project is a structured SQL analysis on electoral bond data in India. It answers business-style questions related to donor behavior, party-wise funding, and bond issuance patterns using real-world-style datasets.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be accessed here:  
👉 [Electoral Bonds Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AHTpFAfFXTzPLJigl9MZWOUlyVO7LVzz)

The data includes:
- `donordata.csv` – Details of donors
- `receiverdata.csv` – Information about receiving political parties
- `bankdata.csv` – Issuing bank data
- `bonddata.csv` – Electoral bond records

## 🧾 Project Files

- `create_and_copy_statements.sql`  
  SQL script to create tables and import data from the dataset.

- `Solutions.sql`  
  SQL queries answering various analytical and business-style questions based on the data.

- `README.md`  
  This file, documenting the project.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

- Engineered a **3NF-compliant relational database** to structure electoral bond data, ensuring data integrity and eliminating redundancy.
- Developed and executed **SQL queries** using `JOINs`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions to identify key funding sources and analyze donation patterns.
- Performed in-depth analysis on **donation tracking**, **geographical distribution of funds**, and **emerging political funding trends** to uncover insights and improve transparency.

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- Who are the top 10 donors?
- Which political party received the most bonds?
- How much did each party receive over the years?
- What is the total amount issued by each bank?
- Which donor donated to multiple parties?
